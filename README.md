# Flearn

Flearn is a minimal learning application fully based on learning theory research.
Flearn implements features that enable effective learning through the following techniques

- Spaced retrieval
- Elaboration
- Generation

Research has proved that the above techniques are effective

## Features

### Flashcards

To aid in spaced retrieval and generation

### Rich text editor

To allow for elaboration of concepts

### Tagging

For easy grouping of notes. We can't use a heirarchical folder structure since notes may cross cut across topics.

### Bidirectional Page linking

To avoid monolithic notes, a note can link to multiple other notes for further elaboration
